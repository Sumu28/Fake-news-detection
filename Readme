# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting **fake news articles** using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
It demonstrates how data-driven models can help combat misinformation by automatically classifying news as *real* or *fake* based on textual content.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧹 **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- 🔠 **Feature Extraction:** Using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
- 🧠 **Prediction Interface:** Simple script to input custom news text and classify as Real or Fake

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib  
- **Dataset:** Kaggle / Publicly Available Fake News Dataset (e.g., `train.csv`, `test.csv`)  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Import and explore dataset  
2. Preprocess text data (cleaning and normalization)  
3. Vectorize text using TF-IDF  
4. Train machine learning models  
5. Evaluate model performance  
6. Deploy or use the trained model for real-time predictions

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.93 | 0.92 | 0.93 | 0.93 |
| Random Forest | 0.91 | 0.90 | 0.91 | 0.91 |

*(Note: Replace with your actual results once tested)*
